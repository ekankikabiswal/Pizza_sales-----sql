# Pizza_sales-----sql 
Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL (MySQL Workbench)

This project explores and analyzes pizza sales data using MySQL Workbench.
It includes end-to-end SQL queries to study orders, revenue, customer trends, and pizza performance.
The project is designed for Data Analyst portfolio building and demonstrates practical SQL skills.

Project Overview

The dataset contains information about:
1. Orders
2.Order details
3.Pizza types
4.Pizza sizes and prices

Using SQL, several analytical questions were solved to understand sales patterns, revenue distribution, and product performance.

✅ Key SQL Tasks Performed
1. Total number of orders placed

Query to count all orders in the dataset.
3. Total revenue generated from pizza sales

Revenue calculated using:
quantity × price with necessary table joins.

3. Highest-priced pizza
Identified the most expensive pizza on the menu.

4. Most common pizza size ordered
Aggregation used to find the most frequently ordered size.

5. Top 5 most ordered pizza types (by quantity)
Sorted and limited to find best-selling pizzas.

6. Order distribution by hour of the day
Used timestamp to analyze customer order patterns.

7. Total quantity ordered for each pizza category
Joined pizza and category tables to calculate category-wise quantities.

8. Category-wise distribution of orders
Breakdown of pizzas sold by category (e.g., Veg, Classic, Supreme).

9. Average number of pizzas ordered per day
Daily trend analysis.

10. Top 3 pizza types based on revenue
Ranked pizzas by total revenue contribution.

11. Percentage revenue contribution of each pizza type
Calculated each pizza's share in total revenue.

12. Cumulative revenue over time
Used window functions to compute running total revenue.

13. Top 3 revenue-generating pizza types within each category
Category-wise ranking using analytic SQL functions.
